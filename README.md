# SharePointSiteOwnerTools
 
Simplified C# Forms project - To show Proof of Concept that using Microsoft's built in ACL SharePoint sites within the same Tenant can be administered individually if your (non-Tenant Admin) account is an 'Owner' or in an 'Admin' role for the individual Site.

Using SharePoint CSOM library, to soon be 'upgraded' to PNP.Framework as CSOM is currently out-of-development.

Compiled for x86 available - including installation in /publish  (Grab entire /publish folder to install locally).

Super RAW with many aspects uncompleted, feel free to contribute - just a small side project when not enjoying normal daily work activies :).
